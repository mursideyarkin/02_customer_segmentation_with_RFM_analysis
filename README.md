RFM analysis is a model for segmenting customers based on three parameters that define their purchase habits. Three parameters are:

**Recency:** How recently a customer has made a purchase.

**Frequency:** How often a customer makes a purchase.

**Monetary:** How much money a customer spends on purchases.
